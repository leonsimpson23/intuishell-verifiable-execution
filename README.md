# IntuiShell — Verifiable Execution Surface

This repository does not contain a system.

It contains evidence of a constraint.

---

## What to observe

An instruction existed.

The machine did not execute it.

Not because of permissions  
Not because of OS policy  
Not because of missing software

Because no human had authorized intent.

After authorization, the identical instruction executed and produced a signed proof artifact recording:

• who approved  
• what ran  
• when it became allowed  

Execution depended on intent.

---

## Public verification artifacts
The JSON files in `/PROOF` are execution attestations.

They can be validated using the provided public key.

They are not logs.  
They exist only because execution occurred after authorization.

---

## What this demonstrates

A computer system that requires human approval before performing actions, while producing verifiable evidence of accountability.

No architecture is published here.

## Inquiry
If you understand the implication of execution requiring intent, you know why this cannot be implemented as a traditional permission model.

Technical discussion available under NDA.
